Encompassing our commitment to ESG, the strategic framework sets our growth and direction against the backdrop of a rapidly changing healthcare ecosystem.

Merck’s strategic framework includes our commitment to operate responsibly to enable a safe, sustainable, and healthy future for people and communities. Building on our legacy of stewardship, and in line with our ESG materiality assessment, we direct resources to drive progress in the four long-standing ESG focus areas that matter most to our Company and create value for our stakeholders: Access to Health, Employees, Environmental Sustainability, and Ethics & Values. We continue to strategically embed actions in each of these areas across our business operations to support and lift our purpose through our ESG approach.

### ESG Focus Areas

## Access to Health

At Merck, we are dedicated to improving access to health by discovering, developing, and providing innovative products and services that save and improve lives. We understand that a robust healthcare ecosystem enhances Merck’s impact, opportunities, and value. Our comprehensive approach to access is guided by our Public Policy and Responsibility Council (PPRC), a senior leadership body that governs our policy and ESG efforts, and our Access to Health Guiding Principles.

### Diversity in Clinical Trials

Our commitment to inclusive clinical trials is a cornerstone of our efforts to ensure that our studies reflect the diverse populations we serve. This begins with selecting clinical trial sites in communities serving underrepresented ethnic groups. By incorporating enrollment and diversity-focused goals, we drive inclusion and access across our programs. We also participate in partnerships and sponsorships to connect with, support, and train U.S.-based clinicians from diverse backgrounds, fostering community-level access to clinical research. Notably, our co-sponsorship of the Improving Patient Access to Cancer Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study at the Lazarex Cancer Foundation aims to enhance patient enrollment, retention, minority participation, and equitable access in oncology trials.

### Discovery and Invention

Merck is committed to discovering and inventing medicines and vaccines that address vital global health needs. Our systematic evaluation of R&D candidates focuses on addressing significant public health challenges and unmet medical needs, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This involves assessing disease burden, availability of alternative treatments, and the appropriateness of our products to improve public health. Our approach ensures that our medicines and vaccines are accessible to as many people as possible, supported by a robust R&D investment of $12.2 billion in 2021.

### Availability

Ensuring a reliable, safe global supply of quality medicines and vaccines is central to our mission. We invest in solutions that enable timely access to our products in a responsible and sustainable manner, maintaining strict quality standards and effective supply chain management.

This effort is bolstered by expansions to our manufacturing capabilities, expected to double HPV vaccine supply between 2020 and 2023.

### Affordability

We collaborate with private, governmental, multilateral, and non-profit organizations to design and deliver solutions addressing access challenges at payer, provider, and patient levels. Our efforts include market-based solutions, product donations, and patient assistance programs. In response to the war in Ukraine, Merck committed over $93 million in essential product donations and funds in the first half of 2022 to ensure access to healthcare for refugees and those in conflict zones.

### Strengthening Systems and Health Equity

Our approach to expanding access is grounded in addressing underlying healthcare system challenges. Merck has a long history of partnering to strengthen health systems and advance health equity. Merck for Mothers, our global initiative, aims to eliminate maternal mortality. With an additional investment of $150 million, we aim to reach 25 million women by 2025, building on the program’s success over the past decade.

Merck’s efforts in these areas demonstrate our unwavering commitment to improving access to health and ensuring our scientific advancements benefit diverse populations worldwide.

## Employees

Our ability to excel depends on the integrity, knowledge, imagination, skill, diversity, and teamwork of our employees. We are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and healthy workforce that drives innovation and business success. Our strategic focus on employees encompasses diversity and inclusion, pay equity, leadership accountability, and employee wellbeing.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We strive to create an environment where every employee feels valued and empowered. Our Global Diversity and Inclusion (GD&I) strategy is integral to our business objectives, emphasizing belonging, engagement, equity, and empowerment. This strategy includes targeted initiatives to increase the representation of women and underrepresented ethnic groups at all leadership levels. In 2021, women represented 36% of senior management and 44% of all managers, while 42% of our executive team and 25% of senior management were from underrepresented ethnic groups.

To expand our pipeline of diverse talent, we have partnered with organizations such as the College Diversity Network and the National Urban League, focusing on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We also address systemic barriers by offering virtual positions, relocation services, and considering candidates without prior pharmaceutical experience.

### Pay Equity

Ensuring fair and equitable pay is a core value at Merck. We conduct annual pay equity studies with external partners, covering approximately 75% of our global employee population. Our goal is to achieve nearly complete global workforce coverage by the end of 2022. As of 2021, we have achieved over 99% pay equity in the U.S. for both gender and ethnic diversity in equivalent positions.

### Leadership Accountability

Our Board of Directors and executive leadership are committed to diversity and inclusion. The Board includes 43% female members and 21% from underrepresented ethnic groups. Regular reviews of diversity metrics by our CEO ensure progress and accountability. Our GD&I Center of Excellence (CoE) oversees the alignment of diversity initiatives with business objectives through diverse ambassador teams from across functional areas.

### Employee Wellbeing

We prioritize the health, wellbeing, and safety of our employees through comprehensive programs focused on prevention, balance, fuel, and movement. Our mental health initiatives, such as the "R U OK?" program and Mental Health Awareness for Managers e-Learning module, support employees in making healthy choices and managing stress. Our Pulse surveys, conducted multiple times a year, help us measure and respond to employee perceptions on inclusion and other critical workforce issues.

Our commitment to employees ensures that we attract and retain a highly qualified workforce, fostering a culture of inclusion, engagement, and innovation. By prioritizing our employees' wellbeing and development, we contribute to the long-term success of our ESG performance and business objectives.

## Environmental Sustainability

A healthy planet is essential to human health and the sustainability of our business. At Merck, our environmental sustainability strategy focuses on driving operational efficiency, designing new products to minimize environmental impact, and reducing impacts across our upstream and downstream value chain. We aim to continuously evolve our efforts in the face of a changing climate, maintaining our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and compliance.

### Climate Action Goals

Merck is dedicated to achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources. Our climate goals include:

- **Reducing Operational GHG Emissions:** Achieve a 46% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.
- **Carbon Neutrality:** Achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2025.
- **Renewable Energy:** Source 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

### Product Stewardship and Green Science

Our product stewardship program focuses on identifying and minimizing potential safety and environmental hazards throughout a product’s lifecycle. We are committed to understanding, managing, and reducing the environmental impacts of our products and materials. Our green and sustainable science program uses a "green-by-design" approach, employing more efficient and innovative processing methods to reduce energy, water, and raw material use, thereby minimizing waste and lowering production costs.

### Value Chain Collaboration

In October 2021, Merck joined Schneider Electric’s Energize program, a collaboration to help pharmaceutical and healthcare suppliers address their Scope 2 GHG emissions through green power procurement. This initiative supports our goal of reducing Scope 3 emissions by helping our suppliers transition to renewable energy sources.

### Progress and Performance

We have made notable progress towards our environmental sustainability goals. In 2021, our Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets were verified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We achieved a 9% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the 2019 baseline and sourced 41% of our purchased electricity from renewables. Despite a 9% increase in Scope 3 emissions from the 2019 baseline, we are committed to improving these metrics and achieving our long-term goals.

Merck’s commitment to environmental sustainability not only supports the health of our planet but also enhances opportunities for product innovation and reduces costs and risks associated with environmental impacts. Through continuous improvement and strategic initiatives, we aim to operate responsibly and contribute to a sustainable future for all.

## Ethics & Values

Ethics and integrity form the cornerstone of Merck's operations. Our unwavering commitment to transparency helps us earn the trust and confidence of our stakeholders. By fostering a fully ethical, values-based, and accountable culture, we improve our decision-making processes, adaptability, and reliability, ensuring that our ethics and values are represented in all our actions.

### Approach to Ethics and Compliance

Merck's Office of Ethics is dedicated to ensuring that all employees are aware of and trained on the Code of Conduct, Our Values and Standards, and Corporate Policies addressing ethics and compliance. Our Code of Conduct, available in 19 languages, outlines clear ethical expectations and principles guiding our company's operations, helping us maintain our hard-earned reputation.

We believe that investing in compliance, risk management, and transparency enhances stakeholder trust and confidence. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct communicates our expectations for human rights, labor, health, safety, environment, and ethical business practices. This code, along with our supplier performance expectations, is provided to all existing and potential third parties engaged in our sourcing initiatives, promoting high standards across our supply chain.

### Promoting a "Speak Up" Culture

Merck's "Speak Up" reporting tool, operated by an independent third party, is available 24/7, allowing employees and suppliers to raise concerns or ask questions confidentially in their chosen language. Outside the U.S., regional ethics officers manage a network of site-based ethics ambassadors who support the "Speak Up" culture by answering questions about the reporting and investigation process and guiding employees to appropriate channels for raising concerns.

Our goal is to foster a "Speak Up" culture by maintaining or exceeding the average percentage of employees willing to report misconduct, as measured in our Pulse surveys conducted multiple times a year. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining 100% compliance with regulatory requirements for active incident monitoring, risk/harm analysis, and timely data breach notifications.

### Managing Digital Risk

In an era of increasing cybersecurity events and innovative data uses, we continuously refine our global privacy program. This program promotes organizational accountability for privacy, data governance, and data protection across our business and with our partners and suppliers. Our efforts are designed to mitigate risks associated with digital operations and maintain stakeholder trust.

### Ethical Leadership Workshops

To strengthen our culture of ethics and integrity, Merck hosted Ethical Leadership workshops in all eight Latin American markets in 2021. These workshops provided leaders with tools to build and sustain a culture of respect and ethical behavior, resulting in improved employee willingness to "Speak up and be open-minded" and "Challenge the status quo."

Merck's commitment to ethics and values is integral to our business strategy, ensuring we operate responsibly while driving growth and innovation. Through continuous improvement and a strong ethical foundation, we aim to maintain the trust and confidence of our stakeholders, contributing to a sustainable and ethical future.

## GRI/SASB Disclosures

As a global healthcare company, Merck is committed to maintaining transparency and accountability through comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. Our disclosures align with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) frameworks to provide clear and comparable information on our ESG performance.

### GRI Disclosures

The GRI Standards are the most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. They provide a framework for organizations to disclose their impacts on the economy, the environment, and society in a consistent and credible manner. Our GRI disclosures include detailed information about our governance structure, business model, stakeholder engagement, and specific ESG topics relevant to our operations. By adhering to these standards, we ensure that our reporting meets the needs of a broad range of stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and communities.

### SASB Disclosures

The SASB standards are designed to help public corporations disclose material, decision-useful information to investors. SASB identifies sustainability topics that are likely to affect the financial condition or operating performance of companies within an industry. Our SASB disclosures cover a range of material topics, including product quality and safety, ethical marketing, employee health and safety, and environmental impacts. These disclosures provide investors with relevant and comparable data to assess our ESG risks and opportunities.

By integrating GRI and SASB standards into our reporting, we enhance the transparency and comparability of our ESG performance. This dual approach allows us to communicate our commitments and progress in a structured manner, meeting the expectations of diverse stakeholders and aligning with best practices in sustainability reporting. Our comprehensive disclosures reflect our dedication to responsible business practices and our ongoing efforts to create value for society.
